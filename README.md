# writing snapshots tests in react
In this tutorial, you wrote snapshot tests for a React component. You also modified the component to experience failing tests. Finally, you updated the snapshots to fix the tests.

This was a small simulation of a live project. This cycle of tests passing, failing, and addressing the failures will be part of your development workflow.

Snapshot testing is meant to be one of many different testing tools. Therefore, you may still need to write tests for your actions and reducers.

While you have explored the basics of snapshot tests, there is a lot you can learn about writing better snapshot tests. Do take a look at the Snapshot best practices from the Jestâ€™s documentation to learn more about snapshot testing.
